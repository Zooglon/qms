#### Q's for Mat -

- Are the 3 roof pitch degrees the only option? Is it worth having another option for 'custom' that leads to 'call to discuss'?
- 'Global' metric/imperial switch or per question?
- Which answers are 'required' and which are 'optional'?
- Doorway questions bit - i'm not 100%
- With things like the additional comments box, would this be sent 'as is' with the quotes.
- I would like the 'am i eligible for grants' bit to be at the end, it could disrupt the flow of the form
- There seems to be two sections for doors in your notes, can we combine?
- Are purlin an option for walls, roof or both?
- Can a shed be multi type? e.g mono pitched with a mezzanine?
- What if I wanted 3 doors of different sizes and placement?

- How do we handle installation and ground levelling quotes?

#### Postcode actions -

- get lat/lng for all suppliers - run an automation when they set up a supplier account?
- if supplier changes address - update field?
- Add supplier quote type

- calculate distance to every supplier when form is submitted - maybve build in some sort of 'start with city/county/region' for better performance?
